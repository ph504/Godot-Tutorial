# Godot tutorial
Related to the Course lab assignments at UNB for the Introduction to Game Development Course (CS2053). I am a teaching assistant for this course, and these are some of the partial solutions for the Godot projects. You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ph504/Godot-Tutorial/tree/main/manuals(revised))!

Disclaimer: these solutions are not absolute, and I don't claim that they are the best possible way to do things, so make sure to try a few more things out yourself!
